Monix

Monix is an Android application and a learning tool that generates meaningful or random mnemonics

and anagrams from any contextual acronyms or word scrambles arranged from study materials

or a list of words. 



Quote (feature)

By converting an acronym to expressive quotes, sayings, or idioms (as mnemonic devices) one can 

better study exam materials by easily recalling those terms.     

For example, the color spectrum ROYBIV is an acronym 

for red, orange, green, blue, indigo, and violent.



Anagram (feature)

By rearranging a word scramble to generate new English words, one can easily recall a list of 

terms by only recalling the rearranged-word. 

For example, we can generate many variants of words with these letters: L, I, S, T, E, N

listen > silent > enlints > enlist > intels > tinsel
