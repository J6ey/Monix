# Monix
***
  Monix is an Android application and a learning tool that generates meaningful or random mnemonics

  and anagrams from contextual acronyms or word scrambles arranged from study materials

  or lists. 



### Quote (feature)
  By converting an acronym to expressive quotes, sayings, or idioms (as mnemonic devices) one can 

  better prepare for exam materials or recall a list of groceries by easily recalling those terms.     

  For example, **the color spectrum ROYBIV is an acronym** 

  **for red, orange, green, blue, indigo, and violent.**



### Anagram (feature)

  By rearranging a word scramble to generate new English words, one can easily recall a list of 

  terms by recalling the newly-arranged words. 

  For example, **we can generate many variants of words with these letters: L, I, S, T, E, N**

  **listen > silent > enlints > enlist > intels > tinsel**
