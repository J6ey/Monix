# Monix

  Monix is an Android learning tool that generates meaningful and random mnemonics

  and anagrams from contextual acronyms to word scrambles arranged from study materials

  and lists. 



### Quote (feature)
  By converting a word scramble to expressive quotes, sayings, or idioms to mnemonic devices one can 

  better prep for exams or recall a list of groceries via simple memorization and recollection.     

  For example, **the color spectrum ROYBIV is an acronym** 

  **for red, orange, green, blue, indigo, and violent.**



### Anagram (feature)

  By rearranging a word scramble to generate a list of English words, one can easily recall a list of 

  terms by recalling the newly-arranged words. 

  For example, **we can generate many variants of words with these letters: L, I, S, T, E, N**

  **listen > silent > enlints > enlist > intels > tinsel**
